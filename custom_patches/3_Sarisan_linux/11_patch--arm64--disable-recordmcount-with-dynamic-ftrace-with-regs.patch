Subject: [PATCH] arm64: disable recordmcount with DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_REGS

DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_REGS uses -fpatchable-function-entry, which makes
running recordmcount unnecessary as there are no mcount calls in object
files, and __mcount_loc doesn't need to be generated.

While there's normally no harm in running recordmcount even when it's
not strictly needed, this won't work with LTO as we have LLVM bitcode
instead of ELF objects.

This change selects FTRACE_MCOUNT_USE_PATCHABLE_FUNCTION_ENTRY, which
disables recordmcount when patchable function entries are used instead.
